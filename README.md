# Stock Trading with Q-Learning

This project uses **Q-Learning** (a reinforcement learning algorithm) to make stock trading decisions (Buy, Sell, Hold) based on historical stock prices.

## Project Structure

- environment.py: Defines the stock trading environment using OpenAI Gym.
- agent.py: Defines the Q-Learning agent.
- train.py: Trains the Q-Learning model.
- test.py: Tests the trained model and displays the results.
- requirements.txt: Lists the required Python libraries.

## Requirements

To install the required libraries, run the following command:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Stock Trading with Q-Learning

This project uses **Q-Learning** (a reinforcement learning algorithm) to make stock trading decisions (Buy, Sell, Hold) based on historical stock prices.

## Project Structure

- environment.py: Defines the stock trading environment using OpenAI Gym.
- agent.py: Defines the Q-Learning agent.
- train.py: Trains the Q-Learning model.
- test.py: Tests the trained model and displays the results.
- requirements.txt: Lists the required Python libraries.

## Requirements

To install the required libraries, run the following command:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## How to Run

1. Prepare your stock data in a CSV file (e.g., `AAPL.csv` for Apple stock).
   - The data should contain at least a 'Close' column with stock closing prices.

2. Train the model using:

bash
python train.py


3. Test the model with:

bash
python test.py


## Results

The agent will learn to make buying and selling decisions based on historical stock prices, optimizing its actions to maximize the cumulative reward.

## Explanation

### Q-Learning Algorithm
-Actions: The agent can either `Buy`, `Sell`, or `Hold` the stock at each time step.
- State: The state is represented by the closing prices of the stock over the last `window_size` days.
- Reward: The reward is calculated based on the price change after taking an action (buy or sell).
  - Positive reward: If the action results in profit.
  - Negative reward: If the action results in a loss.

### Future Improvements
- Implement Deep Q-Learning (DQN) for better handling of complex state spaces.
- Use real-time stock data and integrate with APIs for live trading.
